=head1 NAME

Games::Lacuna::Client::Governor::Party - A plugin for Governor that will automate the hosting of Parties.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Add 'party' to the Governor configuration priorities list.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module examines each colony and hosts a party at each park on it. It will only
execute if a Trade Ministry or Food Reserve is detected as it must verify the
colony has more than 2 food-types. (Less than that will generate negative happiness,
I know this from experience...)

=head2 'party' configuration

This heading contains sub-keys related to parties.
NOTE: C<party> must be a specified item in the priorities list for parties to take place.

=head3 party_above

This is similiar to the C<build_above> setting used in Governor's resource production. This
is the minimum amount of food the colony must maintain if a party is hosted.

=head1 TODO

=head2 Minimum food types

It'd be nice if we had a configuration for how many valid (>500 units) food types must
exist before a party can be hosted.
